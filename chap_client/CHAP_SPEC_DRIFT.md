# chap-core OpenAPI ↔ wire drift notes

Things we've found while writing chap_client where the OpenAPI spec at
`/openapi.json` doesn't match what chap actually returns / accepts.
Each entry is one finding plus the smallest proof. The intent is for
the chap-core team to either fix the spec, fix the wire shape, or
document why they differ.

Filed against chap-core 2.0.0.dev1 (per `/system/info`), tested
against `http://localhost:8000` on **2026-05-08**.

## 1. `ModelSpecRead.target` and `.covariates` are typed as `string` but wire is an object

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/crud/models` (and `/v1/crud/configured-models`,
which returns the same schema)

**Spec says:**
```yaml
ModelSpecRead:
  properties:
    target: {type: string}
    covariates:
      type: array
      items: {type: string}
```

**Wire actually returns:**
```json
{
  "target": {"displayName": "Disease cases", "description": "...", "name": "disease_cases"},
  "covariates": [
    {"displayName": "Rainfall", "description": "...", "name": "rainfall"},
    {"displayName": "Population", "description": "...", "name": "population"}
  ]
}
```

**Likely fix:** introduce a named `Feature` (or `FeatureRef`) component
in the spec with `{name, displayName, description}` and have
`ModelSpecRead.target` reference it (and `.covariates` be an array of
it). chap_client now models it as `ChapFeature`.

**Caught by:** `pydantic_core.ValidationError: Input should be a valid
string` when calling `client.list_models()` against a real chap on
2026-05-08.

## 2. `/v1/crud/models` and `/v1/crud/configured-models` return the same data

**Endpoints:** `GET /v1/crud/models`, `GET /v1/crud/configured-models`

**Observed:** Both endpoints return the same 12-item list with the
same `ModelSpecRead` schema and the same numeric ids (1-12) on a fresh
chap instance. There's no observable difference between the two from
the wire.

**Confusion this causes for callers:** the names suggest a meaningful
distinction ("models" vs "configured models"), but the endpoints
behave identically. A consumer can't tell from the API surface which
one to call, or whether the IDs are interchangeable with downstream
endpoints (see finding 3).

**Likely fix:** either (a) clarify in the spec that these are aliases,
(b) actually differentiate them (e.g. one returns templates and the
other returns configured instances), or (c) deprecate one in favour of
the other.

---

## 3. `POST /v1/crud/configured-models` 500s on a `modelTemplateId` that came from `/v1/crud/models`

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/crud/configured-models`

**Reproduction:** Pick any id from `/v1/crud/models` (e.g. 12). POST
`{"name": "smoke-test", "modelTemplateId": 12}`.

**Wire returns:**
```
HTTP 500
{
  "detail": "Internal server error",
  "error": "Model template with id 12 not found",
  "type": "AssertionError"
}
```

**Root cause:** The id space of `/v1/crud/models` is **not** the id
space of `modelTemplateId`. The valid id space is `/v1/crud/model-templates`,
which on the same instance returns 11 entries (ids 1-11). Picking from
the wrong endpoint silently looks correct (the schema validates) but
fails at chap's persistence layer.

**Two issues stacked:**

1. **The id-space confusion.** Three model-related endpoints
   (`/v1/crud/models`, `/v1/crud/configured-models`,
   `/v1/crud/model-templates`) all expose `id` fields in seemingly
   overlapping ranges, but only one is valid for `modelTemplateId`.
   Either rename for clarity or document the cross-references in the
   schemas.
2. **The 500-instead-of-400.** A user-supplied invalid foreign key
   should return `404 Not Found` or `400 Bad Request`, not `500
   Internal Server Error` with an `AssertionError` leaking out. chap
   knows perfectly well "id 12 not found" -- that's a client error,
   not a server error.

**Likely fix:** validate `modelTemplateId` at request boundaries and
return a typed 4xx with a clear error body. As a bonus, the spec for
this endpoint should reference `ModelTemplateRead.id` so generated
clients can hint about the right id-space.

## 4. `POST /v1/crud/configured-models` mutates the supplied `name`

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/crud/configured-models`

**Reproduction:**
```python
spec = ChapConfiguredModelCreate(name="smoke-test-from-template-1", modelTemplateId=1)
created = client.create_configured_model(spec)
# created.name == "chap_ewars_monthly:smoke-test-from-template-1"
```

**Observed:** chap rewrites the supplied `name` to
`{template_name}:{supplied_name}`. Nothing in the request schema or
endpoint description mentions this -- a caller that needs the saved
name to match the supplied name (e.g. for downstream lookup) gets a
quiet surprise.

**Likely fix:** either (a) document the prefix behaviour in the
endpoint description, or (b) drop the rewrite and let callers pick
their own names. If the prefix is namespacing for collision avoidance,
make it an explicit field (`namespace: str`) so callers know what's
happening.
